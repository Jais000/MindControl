The most basic and non-invasive approach would require a variety of electromagnetic bandwidths which each accord to an accumulation of a particular metals and
simultaneously activate electrons of these molecules with energy levels which do not coincide with the activating energy levels of other metals located elsewhere
in the brain. The energy which is absorbed will activate nodes of ranviers within the axons, and instantiate an event effectively identical to an action potential,
thus allowing the activation of the particular brain region wherein which this accumulation of metal molecules resides. Although non invasive, one's capacity
for control is constrained to the natural distribution of metals within the brain. 



Saturation of the brain with metal molecules which absorb kinetic energy from the electric field of the location of its presence within the brain and
thus instantiate energy jumps of sufficient height to emit radio waves of sufficient frequency; itself being a product of the concentration of said metal
molecules, thereby provides a mean to appreciate brain activity at some height. There shall exist gradience of electron energy levels, such
that the emitted radiowaves emit at a frequency which accords to said height. Upon collection, said data is processed by AI algorithm or Quantum processor,
to which a performed task at the time of reception, is mapped. Thus, there shall exist a mean to appreciate conscious phenomena by said emissions alone.
