The most basic and non-invasive approach would require a variety of electromagnetic bandwidths which each accord to an accumulation of a particular metal and
simultaneously activate electrons of these molecules with energy levels which do not coincide with the activating energy levels of other metals located elsewhere
in the brain. The energy which is absorbed will activate nodes of ranviers within the axons, and instantiate an event effectively identical to an action potential,
thus allowing the activation of the particular brain region wherein which this accumulation of metallic molecules reside. Although non invasive, one's capacity
for control is constrained to the natural distribution of metals within the brain.
